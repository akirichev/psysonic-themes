The community theme catalogue for **[Psysonic](https://github.com/Psychotoxical/psysonic)**, the cross-platform music player.

Psysonic ships with six core themes built in; every other palette lives here and
installs **on demand** from the in-app **Theme Store** — 80-plus and counting.
They range from faithful recolours of beloved open-source palettes (Catppuccin,
Gruvbox, Nord, Dracula, Kanagawa, Nightfox, Atom One, …) to themes inspired by
apps, films, games, and classic operating systems.

A theme is plain CSS that follows a small **safety floor** — no scripts, nothing
loaded off the network. The simplest theme just recolours a set of semantic
tokens, but themes are free-form: any selectors, structure, and animations are
fair game. Store submissions are reviewed by maintainers before they're merged;
you can also import your own `.zip` straight into the app, at your own risk.

## Using themes

In Psysonic, open **Settings → Themes → Theme Store**, then search, preview, and
hit **Install**. Installed themes apply instantly and keep working offline. You
don't need to clone this repo — it's just the source the app reads from.

## How it works

The app reads one auto-generated index, [`registry.json`](registry.json), over
the [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN, and pulls each theme's CSS and
thumbnail on demand. Nothing here is bundled into the app.

## Anatomy of a theme

```
themes/<id>/
├── manifest.json   # id, name, author, version, description, mode, [tags], [minAppVersion], [changelog]
├── theme.css       # your theme's CSS (recolour the semantic tokens, and more)
└── thumbnail.png   # store preview screenshot — PNG/JPG, 16:9 (CI converts to WebP)
```

`theme.css` is free-form CSS. The recommended starting point is to recolour the
semantic tokens in [`schema/allowed-tokens.json`](schema/allowed-tokens.json) on
the `[data-theme='<id>']` root — that recolours the whole app in one place — but
you may also add any selectors, structure, `@media`, and `@keyframes`. Themes can
react to app state via same-element attributes on the root, e.g.
`[data-theme='<id>'][data-playing='true']` (also `data-fullscreen`,
`data-sidebar-collapsed`, `data-lyrics-open`).

The validator (`scripts/validate-theme.mjs`) enforces the **safety floor**, not
your design: no `@import` and `url()` only as `data:` (themes never touch the
network), no scripts (`expression()`, `javascript:`), no `<style>` breakout, and
`@keyframes` names must start with `<id>-` so animations don't collide between
themes. Quality and taste are handled by review.

### Changelog (optional)

Every version bump signals an update to installed clients, but users can't see
*what* changed — especially for non-visual fixes. Add an optional `changelog`
object to your manifest so the store can show an expandable **What's new** on
your theme's card. Keys are `X.Y.Z` versions, each a short list of change lines:

```json
"changelog": {
  "1.2.0": ["Fixed hover contrast on sidebar icons", "Fixed data-playing pulse lag"],
  "1.1.0": ["Softened the accent colour"]
}
```

When you bump `version`, add the matching entry. The store lists every version
you provide, newest first; themes without a changelog simply don't show the
section.

Keys must be plain `X.Y.Z` versions matching your released versions (no
pre-release or build suffixes). Each version lists 1–20 lines of up to 200
characters, and a manifest may carry up to 50 versions.

## Make a theme

1. Copy [`template/`](template/) to `themes/<your-id>/`.
2. Rename the `[data-theme='template']` selector and `manifest.id` to your id
   (lowercase kebab-case, must match the folder name).
3. Recolour the tokens (the simplest path), and/or add your own selectors and
   animations. Unused optional tokens can be trimmed.
4. Add a `thumbnail.png` (or `.jpg`): a **16:9 screenshot** of Psysonic with
   your theme applied (at least 1280×720). CI converts it to an optimized
   `thumbnail.webp` on merge, so you don't need to resize or convert anything —
   just drop in a screenshot. No screenshot yet? Quick placeholder:
   `node scripts/make-thumbnail.mjs themes/<your-id>/thumbnail.png "#15171e" 1280 720`.
5. Validate, then open a pull request.

```
npm install
node scripts/validate-theme.mjs themes/<your-id>   # one theme
node scripts/validate-theme.mjs                    # every theme
```

**Live preview (dev build):** if you run Psysonic from source, start it with
`--theme-watch <path/to/theme.css>` and it hot-reloads your theme on every save —
no zip, no restart. (Dev builds only.)

description conventions, and the PR checklist.

## Registry

[`registry.json`](registry.json) is the single index the app reads. It is
**auto-generated** from the theme manifests — never edit it by hand. A workflow
regenerates it on every push to `main`; locally, run `npm run registry`.
